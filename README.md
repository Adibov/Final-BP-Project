Simple Battle-Ship Project for BP 99-00 in C language written by me.

## Requirements

+ _windows.h_ library (placed in **lib** folder), So you have to run this program on __windows__, not linux or mac OS
+ gcc compiler and default libraries


## How to use
1. Clone repository with <code>git clone https://github.com/Adibov/Final-BP-Project.git</code> command  
2. Compile Main.c file with  <code>gcc ${Main.c directory} -O2 -std=c99 -I ${conio.h directory}</code>
	+ Replace <code>${Main.c directory}</code> with the path that Main.c exists
	+ Replace <code>${conio.h directory}</code> with the path that conio.h exits
3. Follow the instructions along the program & **Enjoy the GAME =)**
